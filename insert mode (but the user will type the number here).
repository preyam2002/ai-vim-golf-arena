kay, let's see. I need to add those number isn brackets at the beginning of each line that has a Pokémon name. The numbers are two digits, like [03], [13], etc. The lines with underscores don't need to be changed. So the first thing is to figure out how to insert these numbers efficiently.
kémon line (Sprigatito)
Repeat the same for each, inserting the specific number.

But doing this 14 times would take a lot of keystrokes. However, since each number is different, there's no way to automate it with a macro. So the minimal keystrokes would be to do this manually for each line, but perhaps using some shortcuts.

Alternatively, maybe using a combination of visual block and entering the numbers. But since the numbers are different lengths (some are two digits, some are one digit with leading zero), that might not help.

Wait, all the numbers in the target are two digits, like [03], [05], etc. So each is two digits. So perhaps we can use a visual block to insert the brackets and then fill in the numbers.

But the numbers vary, so that's not possible. So the only way is to insert each number manually.

So let's calculate the keystrokes for one line:

For Charmander:

0i[03 ]

[03 ]Looking at tt's 7 keystrokes (0, i, [, 0, 3, Space, ], Esc). Wait, but after inserting [03], we need a space before the name? Wait, the target is "[03] Charmander". So after the ], there's a space. So the insertion would be [03]  followed by the rest. So the command would be:

0i[03] he target, the numbers start at 03 for Charmander and go up to 14 for Squirtle, then 07 for Gardevoir and 01 for Alakazam. Wait, that's not sequential. Hmm, maybe the order is different. Let me check the order again.

Original oit, let's count:

0: go to start of line
i: enter insert mode
[03 ] (but wait, the actual insertion is [03] followed by a space. So the sequence is [03] ]. Wait, no. The target is "[03] Charmander". So the inserted text is "[03] " (including the space). So in insert mode, typing [03]  would be 5 characters: [, 0, 3, ], Space. Then Esc.

So the keystrokes for that line would be 0i[03] ]rder:it, no. Wait, the order is [03], then a space. So the insert is [03] followed by a space. So in insert mode, the user types [03] . So the sequence is 0i[03] it, no. Wait, the order is [03], then a space. So the insert is [03] followed by a space. So in insert mode, the user types [03] . So the sequence is 0i[03] 
Ct's 0 (1), i (1), [ (1), 0 (1), 3 (1), ] (1), Space (1), Esc (1). Total 8 keystrokes per line. Then jj to move down two lines to the next Pokémon. So jj is 2 keystrokes. So per line, 8 + 2 = 10 keystrokes. For 14 lines, that's 14*10=140 keystrokes. That's way too many, but perhaps there's a smarter way.

Alternatively, maybe using a macro that inserts the number and moves down, but since each number is different, the macro would have to be modified each time. But that's not feasible.

Wait, perhaps the numbers are in a certain order that can be generated with a counter. Let's see the numbers again:

03, 13, 10, 12, 05, 08, 09, 02, 04, 06, 11, 14, 07, 01.

Looking for a pattern. Let's list them in order of insertion:

Line 1: 03

Line 2: 13

Line3:10

Line4:12

Line5:05

Line6:08

Line7:09

Line8:02

Line9:04

Line10:06

Line11:11

Line12:14

Line13:07

Line14:01

Hmm, not obvious. Maybe they are the Pokédex numbers of these Pokémon. For example, Charmander is #4, but here it's 03. Wait, maybe not. Alternatively, maybe it's a specific order that the user has, but without knowing that, I can't find a pattern. So the numbers are arbitrary.

Therefore, the only way is to insert each number manually. But how to do that with the fewest keystrokes.

Alternative approach: Use a substitution command for each line. For example, for the first line:

:%s/^Charmander/[03] Charmander/

But that would require 14 substitutions, each matching the specific Pokémon name. But that's possible. Let's see:

The first line is "Charmander", replace with "[03] Charmander".

Second line "Sprigatito" → "[13] Sprigatito".

But writing 14 substitutions would take a lot of keystrokes, but maybe it's manageable.

The substitution command for each would be:

:%s/^\(Charmander\)/[03] \1/


But each substitution would need to be written. However, the total number of keystrokes for all substitutions would be:

For each substitution:

:%s/^Pokemon/[xx] Pokemon/


The length varies per Pokémon name. For example, the first substitution is:

:%s/^Charmander/[03] Charmander/


That's 25 characters. But doing this 14 times would be 14*25=350 keystrokes, which is way more than the manual approach. So that's not better.

Alternative idea: Use a macro that inserts the [xx] part, then allows me to type the number, then continues. But since each number is different, I can't record a macro that does it all. But perhaps use a macro that positions the cursor and enters insert mode, then I type the number, then exit and move down.

For example:

Start on the first line.

qq0i[] harmander
Sprigatito
Meowscarada
Pikachu
Feraligatr
Hydreigon
Lucario
 play the macro, it would insert [ at the beginning, then ] and space at the end, then move down two lines. But then I have to manually type the numbers in between. Wait, no. Let me think.

 Wait, the macro would be:

 qq: start recording to register q.

 0: go to start of line.

 i[Blaziken
Dragonite
G: append after the cursor. Wait, but after inserting [ at the start, the cursor is after the [. So if I do a, I can insert the numbers and then ] and space.

Wait, let's try:

qq0i[a] rchomp
Pidgeot
Squirtle
Gardevoir
Ait, let's break it down:

0: go to start of line.

i[lakazam

Target ort (now cursor is on 'C').

Then i to enter insert mode again, type the number (but this part can't be recorded because the number varies), then ] , then Esc. But since the number varies, the macro can't include that. So maybe the macro would leave the cursor in the right place to type the number.

Alternatively, after inserting the [ at the start, the cursor is after the [. Then, in insert mode, type the number, then ] , then exit.

But since the number varies, the macro can't type it. So the macro would need to position the cursor between the [ and the Pokémon name, then the user types the number, then ] , then move down.

But how to do that.

Alternative approach:

Record a macro that does:

0i[iiiwith nfter playing the macro, the user has to type the number between the [ and the existing text.

Wait, let's see:

Starting on "Charmander".

Macro steps:

qq0i[umbers:
[03] Charmander
 to enter insert mode, type the number (03), then ] , then Esc.

 Wait, but the macro can't type 03 for us. So the macro would need to leave the cursor in insert mode after the [ so the user can type the number, then ] .

 But how to structure that.

 Alternatively, the macro could insert [  ]  and position the cursor between the brackets.

 For example:

 qq0i[ 

 This would insert "[  ] " at the start, then move back two spaces (inside the brackets) and enter insert mode. Then the user can type the number (e.g., 03), then exit and move down.

 But then, after typing the number, the user has to exit insert mode and move down. But that would require more steps.

 Let me think:

 Macro steps:

 qq0i[

 Wait, let's break it down:

 0: go to start of line.

 i: insert mode.

 [  ] : type "[  ] " (assuming two spaces between brackets and a space after).

 Esc: exit insert mode.

 2h: move left two times (from after the space to between the brackets).

 i: enter insert mode again.

 Now, the user can type the number (e.g., 03), then Esc, then jj to move down.

 But this requires the user to type the number, then exit, then move. But the macro can't do that for all lines since the numbers vary.

 So the macro would be:

 qq0i[

 Then, when you play the macro, you type the number, then ] ] ] [13] Sprigatito
[10] Meowscarada
[12] Pikachut's still a lot of keystrokes, but maybe less than doing it manually.

But how many keystrokes per line:

Play macro: @q (2 keystrokes)

Type the number: 2 digits (2 keystrokes)

Esc (1)

jj (2)

Total per line: 2+2+1+2=7 keystrokes. For 14 lines: 14*7=98, plus recording the macro.

But recording the macro would take:

qq0i[q → that's 12 keystrokes.

So total keystrokes: 12 (recording) + 14*7 = 12 + 98 = 110. That's better than the previous approach.

But wait, after typing the number and Esc, the user has to move down two lines (jj). But if the macro includes the jj, then after typing the number and Esc, the macro would handle moving down.

Wait, let's adjust the macro:

The macro would be:

qq0i[

Then, after typing the number, the user has to exit insert mode and move down. But that's manual.

Alternatively, the macro could include the movement after inserting the number. But since the number varies, the macro can't include that.

Hmm, this seems tricky. Maybe the best approach is to use a combination of a macro and manual input.

Alternatively, use a global command to add the brackets and numbers. But since the numbers are arbitrary, it's not possible.

Another idea: Use the :put command with the numbers. But I'm not sure.

Alternatively, use a block selection to insert the [ and ] parts, then fill in the numbers.

For example:

- Go to the first line.
- Enter visual block mode (Ctrl-v), select the first column of all Pokémon lines.
- Insert [ at the beginning.
- Then go to the position after where the numbers should be, insert ] and space.

But the numbers are two digits, so the block would need to have space for two digits. But since the numbers vary in digits (like 01, 05, 12, etc.), but all are two digits, maybe this is possible.

Wait, all numbers in the target are two digits, like [03], [13], etc. So each number is two digits. So the format is [XX] where XX is two digits.

So the plan is:

1. Insert [ at the beginning of each Pokémon line.
2. Move two characters to the right (to where the number ends), insert ] and space.
3. Then fill in the numbers manually.

But how to do this.

Step 1: Insert [ at the start of each Pokémon line.

The Pokémon lines are every other line starting from line 1. So lines 1,3,5,...27 (assuming 14 Pokémon lines). To select all these lines, perhaps use :g/^[^_]/normal! ...

But maybe use a global command to add the [ at the start.

For example:

:g/^[^_]/norm! I[

This would, for every line that does not start with an underscore (i.e., the Pokémon lines), insert [ at the beginning.

Then, we need to add the ] and space after the two digits. But since the numbers are not there yet, this might not work.

Alternatively, after inserting the [, we can then move two characters right and insert ] .

But how to do that.

After inserting the [ at the start of each Pokémon line, the cursor is at the beginning of the line. Then, we need to move two characters right (to where the number would be), then insert ] , then move back to insert the numbers.

But this requires a second global command.

So:

First command:

:g/^[^_]/norm! I[

Second command:

:g/^[^_]/norm! 2lA] 

Wait, let's break it down.

After inserting the [ at the start, the line is like "[Charmander".

Then, 2l moves two characters to the right (to the 'C' in "Charmander").

Then A appends at the end of the line, which is not what we want. Wait, no. Wait, after moving two characters right (from the start: [ is at position 0, then 1 is 'C', 2 is 'h'), so 2l moves to the third character. Then, using A would go to the end of the line, which is not desired.

Alternatively, use i to insert before the current character. But perhaps:

After inserting the [ at the start, we need to insert two characters (for the number), then ] .

But since the numbers are not there yet, this approach might not work.

Alternatively, first insert [ at the start, then insert two spaces, then ] , and then fill in the numbers.

So:

Step 1: Insert [ at the start of each Pokémon line.

Step 2: Insert two spaces after the [.

Step 3: Insert ]  after the two spaces.

Then, the line would look like "[  ] Charmander".

Then, the user can go to each line and replace the two spaces with the number.

But how to do this with Vim commands.

First, for step 1:

:g/^[^_]/norm! I[

Then, step 2: insert two spaces after the [.

:g/^[^_]/norm! lllll

Wait, no. After inserting the [ at the start, the line is "[Charmander". To insert two spaces after the [, we can do:

:g/^[^_]/norm! lll

Wait, no. Let's think:

After inserting the [ at the start, the cursor is at position 0 (the [). Then, entering insert mode after the [ and adding two spaces.

So for each line:

0i[] n a global command:

:g/^[^_]/norm! 0i[] t's complicated. Alternatively, use a substitution.

First substitution to add [ at the start:

:%s/^\([^_]\)/[\\1/

Wait, no. The regex would match lines that do not start with an underscore. So:

:g!/^_/ s/^/[/


This would add [ to the start of each line that does not start with _.

Then, to add two spaces and ]  after the [:

But how? For example, changing "[Charmander" to "[  ] Charmander".

We can use a substitution to replace the [ at the start with [  ] .

Wait, but the substitution would be:

:%s/^\[\(.*\)/[  ] \1/

But this would replace the [ at the start with [  ] followed by the rest of the line.

But this would work if the first character is [. So after the first substitution, the lines start with [. Then:

:g!/^_/ s/^\[/[  ] /


Wait, but that would replace [ with [  ] and a space. So the line becomes "[  ] Charmander".

But then we need to insert the numbers between the [ and the ].

So now each Pokémon line looks like "[  ] Charmander".

Now, the user needs to replace the two spaces with the numbers. For example, for the first line, replace "  " with "03".

This can be done with a substitution for each line, but again, each line has a unique number.

Alternatively, use a macro to navigate to the first space and enter insert mode.

For example:

/^\[  ]
 to find the first line.

 Then, 2l to move to the first space, then i to insert, type the number, then Esc.

 But again, this requires manual input for each line.

 But perhaps combining this with a macro that moves to the next line and positions the cursor.

 But this seems time-consuming.

 Alternatively, use a macro that positions the cursor between the brackets and enters insert mode, then the user types the number, then exits and moves to the next line.

 For example:

 qq/^\[  ]
 2li
[05] Feraligatr
[08] Hydreigon
[09] Lucario
[i0y the macro 14 times, each time typing the number.

But the macro would be:

qq: start recording.

/^\[  ]
: search for the pattern "[  ] " at the start of a line.

2l: move right two times (to the first space between the brackets).

i: enter insert mode.

2] Blaziken
[04] Dragonite
[06] Garchomp
[11] Pidgeot
[14] Squirtle
[07] Gardevoir
[01] Alakazam

So the numbers aren't in order. That complicates things. Maybe each Pokémon has a specific number that needs to be inserted. Since they're not sequential, a simple macro with an incrementing counter might not work. So perhaps I need to manually insert each number. But that would take a lot of keystrokes. There must be a smarter way.

Wait, maybe the numbers are based on the original order. Let's see:

Original lines (only the Pokémon lines, ignoring underscores):

1. Charmander → [03]
2. Sprigatito → [13]
3. Meowscarada → [10]
4. Pikachu → [12]
5. Feraligatr → [05]
6. Hydreigon → [08]
7. Lucario → [09]
8. Blaziken → [02]
9. Dragonite → [04]
10. Garchomp → [06]
11. Pidgeot → [11]
12. Squirtle → [14]
13. Gardevoir → [07]
14. Alakazam → [01]

Hmm, the numbers don't correspond to their line numbers. So each line needs a specific number. That means I can't use a simple incrementing counter. So maybe the best approach is to use a substitution for each line, but that would require 14 substitutions, which is not efficient. Alternatively, maybe there's a pattern in the numbers that I can exploit.

Alternatively, perhaps the numbers are based on the length of the Pokémon's name or some other characteristic. Let me check:

Charmander (10 letters) → 03. Hmm, 10 letters but 03. Doesn't match. Sprigatito (10 letters) → 13. No. Maybe not.

Alternatively, maybe the numbers are from a list that's provided elsewhere, but since I don't have that info, I have to assume that each line needs a specific number. So the only way is to insert each number manually. But how to do that efficiently in Vim.

Let me think. The lines that need modification are every other line (the ones with the Pokémon names). The lines with underscores are unchanged. So the cursor starts at the first line (Charmander). Let's see:

The steps would be:

1. Insert [03] at the beginning of the first line.
2. Move down to the next Pokémon line (Sprigatito), insert [13].
3. Repeat for each line.

But doing this manually for 14 lines would be time-consuming. So maybe using a macro that records inserting the number and moving down, but since each number is different, the macro would need to be adjusted each time, which isn't possible. So perhaps the best way is to use a combination of block selection and entering the numbers.

Wait, maybe the numbers are in a certain order. Let me list the numbers in the order they appear in the target:

03, 13, 10, 12, 05, 08, 09, 02, 04, 06, 11, 14, 07, 01.

Looking for a pattern here. Maybe not. So each line's number is unique and not following a sequence. Therefore, the only way is to insert each number manually.

But how to do that with minimal keystrokes. Let's think about the process for each line:

For each Pokémon line:

- Go to the beginning of the line (0)
- Insert [ (I[)
- Type the two-digit number (e.g., 03)
- Type ]  (then escape)
- Move down two lines (j twice, since the next Pokémon is two lines down, after the underscores)

Wait, the structure of the text is:

Charmander
____________________
Sprigatito
____________________
...

So each Pokémon is on a line, followed by a line of underscores. So the next Pokémon is two lines down. So from Charmander, jj takes us to Sprigatito.

So the process would be:

On the first line (Charmander):

- 0 to go to the start
- i[03] ]
Charmander
